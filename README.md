Eventually this could become full blown PDF Files Manager that could split, merge and encript PDF files using functionality provided by Ghostscript.

Currently it could be used to print PDF files directly to network printers that support Postscript.

In the case of Xerox Phaser 6180 this program prints **20 times faster** than if you go File -> Print in any application in Ubuntu.
